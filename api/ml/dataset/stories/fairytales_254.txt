Titty went off rubbing her sides; but this time she did not dare to
disobey, and in a very bad temper stooped down over the well. It was not
at all easy to fill the milk-can, which was large and round. It would
not go down into the well, and the gypsy had to try again and again.

At last her arms grew so tired that when she did manage to get the
can properly under the water she had no strength to pull it up, and it
rolled to the bottom.

On seeing the can disappear, she made such a miserable face that Zizi,
who had been watching her all this time, burst into fits of laughter.

Titty turned round and perceived the mistake she had made; and she felt
so angry that she made up her mind to be revenged at once.

'What are you doing there, you lovely creature?' she said to Zizi.

'I am waiting for my lover,' Zizi replied; and then, with a simplicity
quite natural in a girl who so lately had been a canary, she told all
her story.

The gypsy had often seen the young Prince pass by, with his gun on his
shoulder, when he was going after crows. She was too ugly and ragged
for him ever to have noticed her, but Titty on her side had admired him,
though she thought he might well have been a little fatter.

'Dear, dear!' she said to herself. 'So he likes yellow women! Why, I am
yellow too, and if I could only think of a way----'

It was not long before she did think of it.

'What!' cried the sly Titty, 'they are coming with great pomp to fetch
you, and you are not afraid to show yourself to so many fine lords and
ladies with your hair down like that? Get down at once, my poor child,
and let me dress your hair for you!'

The innocent Zizi came down at once, and stood by Titty. The gypsy began
to comb her long brown locks, when suddenly she drew a pin from her
stays, and, just as the titmouse digs its beak into the heads of linnets
and larks, Titty dug the pin into the head of Zizi.

No sooner did Zizi feel the prick of the pin than she became a bird
again, and, spreading her wings, she flew away.

'That was neatly done,' said the gypsy. 'The Prince will be clever if
he finds his bride.' And, arranging her dress, she seated herself on the
grass to await Desire.
