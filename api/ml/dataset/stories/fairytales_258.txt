'Will some one be kind enough to tell me the meaning of all this?' cried
the Lord of Avesnes.

'Your Excellency, it is the bird,' replied the Scullion, and he placed
it in his hand.

'Nonsense! What a lovely bird!' said Tubby, and in stroking its head he
touched a pin that was sticking between its feathers. He pulled it out,
and lo! the Canary at once became a beautiful girl with a golden skin
who jumped lightly to the ground.

'Gracious! what a pretty girl!' said Tubby.

'Father! it is she! it is Zizi!' exclaimed Desire, who entered at this
moment.

And he took her in his arms, crying: 'My darling Zizi, how happy I am to
see you once more!'

'Well, and the other one?' asked Tubby.

The other one was stealing quietly to the door.

'Stop her! called Tubby. 'We will judge her cause at once.'

And he seated himself solemnly on the oven, and condemned Titty to
be burned alive. After which the lords and cooks formed themselves in
lines, and Tubby betrothed Desire to Zizi.
