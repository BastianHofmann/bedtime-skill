They danced on till the shoes of the princesses were worn into holes.
When the cock crowed the third time the fiddles stopped, and a delicious
supper was served by negro boys, consisting of sugared orange flowers,
crystallised rose leaves, powdered violets, cracknels, wafers, and other
dishes, which are, as everyone knows, the favourite food of princesses.

After supper, the dancers all went back to their boats, and this time
the Star Gazer entered that of the eldest Princess. They crossed again
the wood with the diamond-spangled leaves, the wood with gold-sprinkled
leaves, and the wood whose leaves glittered with drops of silver, and as
a proof of what he had seen, the boy broke a small branch from a tree in
the last wood. Lina turned as she heard the noise made by the breaking
of the branch.

'What was that noise?' she said.

'It was nothing,' replied her eldest sister; 'it was only the screech of
the barn-owl that roosts in one of the turrets of the castle.'

While she was speaking Michael managed to slip in front, and running up
the staircase, he reached the princesses' room first. He flung open
the window, and sliding down the vine which climbed up the wall, found
himself in the garden just as the sun was beginning to rise, and it was
time for him to set to his work.
