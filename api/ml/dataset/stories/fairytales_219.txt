The twelve princesses went upstairs to bed. Michael followed them, and
waited behind the open door till they gave the signal for departure.

This time he did not cross in Lina's boat. He gave his arm to the eldest
sister, danced with each in turn, and was so graceful that everyone
was delighted with him. At last the time came for him to dance with the
little Princess. She found him the best partner in the world, but he did
not dare to speak a single word to her.

When he was taking her back to her place she said to him in a mocking
voice:

'Here you are at the summit of your wishes: you are being treated like a
prince.'

'Don't be afraid,' replied the Star Gazer gently. 'You shall never be a
gardener's wife.'

The little Princess stared at him with a frightened face, and he left
her without waiting for an answer.

When the satin slippers were worn through the fiddles stopped, and the
negro boys set the table. Michael was placed next to the eldest sister,
and opposite to the youngest.

They gave him the most exquisite dishes to eat, and the most delicate
wines to drink; and in order to turn his head more completely,
compliments and flattery were heaped on him from every side.

But he took care not to be intoxicated, either by the wine or the
compliments.
