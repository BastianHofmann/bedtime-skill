Everything the Princess saw was new to her, and in passing through
mountains, valleys, and towns, she asked a thousand questions. Desire
was charmed to answer them. It is so delightful to teach those one
loves!

Once she inquired what the girls in his country were like.

'They are pink and white,' he replied, 'and their eyes are blue.'

'Do you like blue eyes?' said the Princess; but Desire thought it was
a good opportunity to find out what was in her heart, so he did not
answer.

'And no doubt,' went on the Princess, 'one of them is your intended
bride?'

Still he was silent, and Zizi drew herself up proudly.

'No,' he said at last. 'None of the girls of my own country are
beautiful in my eyes, and that is why I came to look for a wife in the
land of the sun. Was I wrong, my lovely Zizi?'

This time it was Zizi's turn to be silent.
