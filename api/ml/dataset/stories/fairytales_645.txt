_The Moral_

    _Money and jewels still, we find,
    Stamp strong impressions on the mind.
    But sweet discourse more potent riches yields;
    Of higher value is the pow'r it wields._


_Another_

      _Civil behaviour costs indeed some pains,
    Requires of complaisance some little share;
      But soon or late its due reward it gains,
    And meets it often when we're not aware._
