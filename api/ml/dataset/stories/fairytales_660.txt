_The Moral_

    _At many children parents don't repine,
    If they are handsome; in their judgment shine;
    Polite in carriage are, in body strong,
    Graceful in mien, and elegant in tongue.
    But if perchance an offspring prove but weak,
    Him they revile, laugh at, defraud and cheat.
    Such is the wretched world's curs'd way; and yet
    Sometimes this urchin whom despis'd we see,
    Through unforeseen events doth honour get,
    And fortune bring to all his family._
