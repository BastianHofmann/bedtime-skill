That day, when he made up the bouquets, Michael hid the branch with the
silver drops in the nosegay intended for the youngest Princess.

When Lina discovered it she was much surprised. However, she said
nothing to her sisters, but as she met the boy by accident while she was
walking under the shade of the elms, she suddenly stopped as if to speak
to him; then, altering her mind, went on her way.

The same evening the twelve sisters went again to the ball, and the Star
Gazer again followed them and crossed the lake in Lina's boat. This time
it was the Prince who complained that the boat seemed very heavy.

'It is the heat,' replied the Princess. 'I, too, have been feeling very
warm.'

During the ball she looked everywhere for the gardener's boy, but she
never saw him.

As they came back, Michael gathered a branch from the wood with the
gold-spangled leaves, and now it was the eldest Princess who heard the
noise that it made in breaking.

'It is nothing,' said Lina; 'only the cry of the owl which roosts in the
turrets of the castle.'
