Renelde did try, and to her great surprise the nettles when crushed and
prepared gave a good thread, soft and light and firm. Very soon she had
spun the first shift, which was for her own wedding. She wove and cut
it out at once, hoping that the Count would not force her to begin the
other. Just as she had finished sewing it, Burchard the Wolf passed by.

'Well,' said he, 'how are the shifts getting on?'

'Here, my lord, is my wedding garment,' answered Renelde, showing him
the shift, which was the finest and whitest ever seen.

The Count grew pale, but he replied roughly, 'Very good. Now begin the
other.'

The spinner set to work. As the Count returned to the castle, a cold
shiver passed over him, and he felt, as the saying is, that some one was
walking over his grave. He tried to eat his supper, but could not; he
went to bed shaking with fever. But he did not sleep, and in the morning
could not manage to rise.

This sudden illness, which every instant became worse, made him very
uneasy. No doubt Renelde's spinning-wheel knew all about it. Was it not
necessary that his body, as well as his shroud, should be ready for the
burial?

The first thing Burchard did was to send to Renelde and to stop her
wheel.

Renelde obeyed, and that evening Guilbert asked her:

'Has the Count given his consent to our marriage?'

'No,' said Renelde.

'Continue your work, sweetheart. It is the only way of gaining it. You
know he told you so himself.'
