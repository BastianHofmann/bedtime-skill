Nevertheless, the Star Gazer had another dream. The lady in the golden
dress appeared to him once more, holding in one hand two young laurel
trees, a cherry laurel and a rose laurel, and in the other hand a
little golden rake, a little golden bucket, and a silken towel. She thus
addressed him:

'Plant these two laurels in two large pots, rake them over with the
rake, water them with the bucket, and wipe them with the towel. When
they have grown as tall as a girl of fifteen, say to each of them, ''My
beautiful laurel, with the golden rake I have raked you, with the golden
bucket I have watered you, with the silken towel I have wiped you.''
Then after that ask anything you choose, and the laurels will give it to
you.'

Michael thanked the lady in the golden dress, and when he woke he found
the two laurel bushes beside him. So he carefully obeyed the orders he
had been given by the lady.

The trees grew very fast, and when they were as tall as a girl of
fifteen he said to the cherry laurel, 'My lovely cherry laurel, with
the golden rake I have raked thee, with the golden bucket I have watered
thee, with the silken towel I have wiped thee. Teach me how to become
invisible.' Then there instantly appeared on the laurel a pretty white
flower, which Michael gathered and stuck into his button-hole.
