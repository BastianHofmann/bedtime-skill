At last the eldest sister made a sign, and one of the black pages
brought in a large golden cup.

'The enchanted castle has no more secrets for you,' she said to the Star
Gazer. 'Let us drink to your triumph.'

He cast a lingering glance at the little Princess, and without
hesitation lifted the cup.

'Don't drink!' suddenly cried out the little Princess; 'I would rather
marry a gardener.'

And she burst into tears.

Michael flung the contents of the cup behind him, sprang over the table,
and fell at Lina's feet. The rest of the princes fell likewise at the
knees of the princesses, each of whom chose a husband and raised him to
her side. The charm was broken.

The twelve couples embarked in the boats, which crossed back many times
in order to carry over the other princes. Then they all went through
the three woods, and when they had passed the door of the underground
passage a great noise was heard, as if the enchanted castle was
crumbling to the earth.

They went straight to the room of the Duke of Beloeil, who had just
awoke. Michael held in his hand the golden cup, and he revealed the
secret of the holes in the shoes.

'Choose, then,' said the Duke, 'whichever you prefer.'

'My choice is already made,' replied the garden boy, and he offered his
hand to the youngest Princess, who blushed and lowered her eyes.
