The marriage took place a few days later. All the boys in the country
side were there, armed with wooden swords, and decorated with epaulets
made of gilt paper.

Zizi obtained Titty's pardon, and she was sent back to the brick-fields,
followed and hooted at by all the boys. And this is why to-day the
country boys always throw stones at a titmouse.

On the evening of the wedding-day all the larders, cellars, cupboards
and tables of the people, whether rich or poor, were loaded as if by
enchantment with bread, wine, beer, cakes and tarts, roast larks, and
even geese, so that Tubby could not complain any more that his son had
married Famine.

Since that time there has always been plenty to eat in that country, and
since that time, too, you see in the midst of the fair-haired blue-eyed
women of Flanders a few beautiful girls, whose eyes are black and whose
skins are the colour of gold. They are the descendants of Zizi.(21)
