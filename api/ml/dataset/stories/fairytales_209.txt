When he reached the castle, Michael went straight to the gardener and
offered his services. Now it happened that the garden boy had just
been sent away, and though the Star Gazer did not look very sturdy,
the gardener agreed to take him, as he thought that his pretty face and
golden curls would please the princesses.

The first thing he was told was that when the princesses got up he was
to present each one with a bouquet, and Michael thought that if he had
nothing more unpleasant to do than that he should get on very well.

Accordingly he placed himself behind the door of the princesses'
room, with the twelve bouquets in a basket. He gave one to each of the
sisters, and they took them without even deigning to look at the lad,
except Lina the youngest, who fixed her large black eyes as soft as
velvet on him, and exclaimed, 'Oh, how pretty he is--our new flower
boy!' The rest all burst out laughing, and the eldest pointed out that a
princess ought never to lower herself by looking at a garden boy.

Now Michael knew quite well what had happened to all the princes, but
notwithstanding, the beautiful eyes of the Princess Lina inspired him
with a violent longing to try his fate. Unhappily he did not dare to
come forward, being afraid that he should only be jeered at, or even
turned away from the castle on account of his impudence.
