Talking in this way they drew near to the castle. When they were about
four stone-throws from the gates they dismounted in the forest, by the
edge of a fountain.

'My dear Zizi,' said Tubby's son, 'we cannot present ourselves before
my father like two common people who have come back from a walk. We must
enter the castle with more ceremony. Wait for me here, and in an hour I
will return with carriages and horses fit for a princess.'

'Don't be long,' replied Zizi, and she watched him go with wistful eyes.

When she was left by herself the poor girl began to feel afraid. She
was alone for the first time in her life, and in the middle of a thick
forest.

Suddenly she heard a noise among the trees. Fearing lest it should be
a wolf, she hid herself in the hollow trunk of a willow tree which hung
over the fountain. It was big enough to hold her altogether, but she
peeped out, and her pretty head was reflected in the clear water.

Then there appeared, not a wolf, but a creature quite as wicked and
quite as ugly. Let us see who this creature was.
