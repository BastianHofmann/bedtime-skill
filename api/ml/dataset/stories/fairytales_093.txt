   That is, a race-course for sallies of wit and eloquence
  on the subject of wine: the word "kumeyt" being used, in
  preference to more than a hundred others that might have been
  employed, as signifying "wine," because it bears also the
  meaning of "a dark bay horse."

   The cup, when full, was generally called "kas:" when

  small glass used for brandy and liqueurs, and similar to our
  liqueur-glass: the glass or cup used for wine is called, when
  so used, "koobeh:" it is the same as that used for sherbet; but
  in the latter case it is called "ulleh."

   D'Ohsson (vol. i. pp. 315 and 316) asserts the ub to be
  the chief minister of the Ghos; and gives an account somewhat
  different from that which I offer of the orders under his
  authority: but perhaps the Turkish Darweeshes differ from the
  Arab in their tenets on this subject.

   It is said that "the Nuaba are three hundred; the
  Nujaba, seventy; the Abdal, forty; the Akhyar, seven; the
  'Omud, four; the Ghos  is one. The Nuaba
  reside in El-Gharb ; the
  Nujaba, in Egypt; the Abdal, in Syria; the Akhyar travel about
  the earth; the 'Omud, in the corners of the earth; the abode of
  the Ghos is at Mekkeh. In an affair of need, the Nuaba implore
  relief for the people; then, the Nujaba; then, the Abdal; then,
  the Akhyar; then, the 'Omud; and if their prayer be not
  answered, the Ghos implores, and his prayer is answered."
  (El-Is-aee's History, preface.)--This statement, I find,
  rests on the authority of a famous saint of Baghdad, Aboo-Bekr
  El-Kettanee, who died at Mekkeh, in the year of the Flight 322.
