_The Moral_

    _How advantageous it may be,
    By long descent of pedigree,
              T'enjoy a great estate,
    Yet knowledge how to act, we see,
    Join'd with consummate industry,
              (Nor wonder ye thereat)
    Doth often prove a greater boon,
    As should be to young people known._


_Another_

    _If the son of a miller so soon gains the heart
    Of a beautiful princess, and makes her impart
    Sweet languishing glances, eyes melting for love,
    It must be remark'd of fine clothes how they move,
    And that youth, a good face, a good air, with good mien,
    Are not always indifferent mediums to win
    The love of the fair, and gently inspire
    The flames of sweet passion, and tender desire._
