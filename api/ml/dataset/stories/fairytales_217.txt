Lina's sisters had seen her talking to the little garden boy, and jeered
at her for it.

'What prevents your marrying him?' asked the eldest, 'you would become
a gardener too; it is a charming profession. You could live in a cottage
at the end of the park, and help your husband to draw up water from the
well, and when we get up you could bring us our bouquets.'

The Princess Lina was very angry, and when the Star Gazer presented her
bouquet, she received it in a disdainful manner.

Michael behaved most respectfully. He never raised his eyes to her, but
nearly all day she felt him at her side without ever seeing him.

One day she made up her mind to tell everything to her eldest sister.

'What!' said she, 'this rogue knows our secret, and you never told me! I
must lose no time in getting rid of him.'

'But how?'

'Why, by having him taken to the tower with the dungeons, of course.'

For this was the way that in old times beautiful princesses got rid of
people who knew too much.

But the astonishing part of it was that the youngest sister did not seem
at all to relish this method of stopping the mouth of the gardener's
boy, who, after all, had said nothing to their father.
