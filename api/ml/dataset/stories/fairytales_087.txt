   A recent traveller has questioned Mr. Lane's authority,
  in the "Modern Egyptians," for the remark that Muslims should
  not pray in the bath. A reference to any well-known collection
  of traditions of the Prophet will, however, prove, by many
  sayings besides that quoted above, that Mr. Lane is in this
  matter strictly accurate.--ED.

   A pious Muslim generally sits at his meals with the right
  knee raised, after the example of the Prophet, who adopted this
  custom in order to avoid too comfortable a posture in eating,
  as tempting to unnecessary gratification.--ED.

   See "Modern Egyptians," vol. ii., close of chap,
  ix.--Since this was written, I have found that El-Idreesee
  applies the term "asheesheeyeh," which is exactly synonymous
  with "ashshasheen," to the "Assassins:" this, therefore,
  decides the question.
