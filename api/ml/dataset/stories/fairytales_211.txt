That evening, when the princesses went upstairs to bed, he followed them
barefoot, so that he might make no noise, and hid himself under one of
the twelve beds, so as not to take up much room.

The princesses began at once to open their wardrobes and boxes. They
took out of them the most magnificent dresses, which they put on before
their mirrors, and when they had finished, turned themselves all round
to admire their appearances.

Michael could see nothing from his hiding-place, but he could hear
everything, and he listened to the princesses laughing and jumping with
pleasure. At last the eldest said, 'Be quick, my sisters, our partners
will be impatient.' At the end of an hour, when the Star Gazer heard
no more noise, he peeped out and saw the twelve sisters in splendid
garments, with their satin shoes on their feet, and in their hands the
bouquets he had brought them.

'Are you ready?' asked the eldest.

'Yes,' replied the other eleven in chorus, and they took their places
one by one behind her.

Then the eldest Princess clapped her hands three times and a trap door
opened. All the princesses disappeared down a secret staircase, and
Michael hastily followed them.

As he was following on the steps of the Princess Lina, he carelessly
trod on her dress.

'There is somebody behind me,' cried the Princess; 'they are holding my
dress.'

'You foolish thing,' said her eldest sister, 'you are always afraid of
something. It is only a nail which caught you.'
