_The Moral_

    _What in this little Tale we find,
    Is less a fable than real truth.
    In those we love appear rare gifts of mind,
    And body too: wit, judgment, beauty, youth._


_Another_

    _A countenance whereon, by natures hand,
    Beauty is trac'd, also the lively stain
    Of such complexion art can ne'er attain,
    With all these gifts hath not so much command
    On hearts, as hath one secret charm alone.
    Love finds that out, to all besides unknown._
