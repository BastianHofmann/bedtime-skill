The Caravan had reached the end of the desert, and gladly did the
travellers salute the green meadows, and thickly-leaved trees, of
whose charms they had been deprived for so many days. In a lovely
valley lay a caravansery, which they selected as their resting-place
for the night; and though it offered but limited accommodations and
refreshment, still was the whole company more happy and sociable than
ever: for the thought of having passed through the dangers and
hardships, with which a journey through the desert is ever
accompanied, had opened every heart, and attuned their minds to jest
and gayety. Muley, the young and merry merchant, went through a comic
dance, and sang songs thereto, which elicited a laugh, even from
Zaleukos, the serious Greek. But not content with having raised the
spirits of his comrades by dance and merriment, he also gave them, in
the best style, the story he had promised, and, as soon as he could
recover breath from his gambols, began the following tale.
