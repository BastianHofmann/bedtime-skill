The King's Son


  Who rideth through the driving rain
    At such a headlong speed?
  Naked and pale he rides amain
    Upon a naked steed.

  Nor hollow nor height his going bars,
    His wet steed shines like silk,
  His head is golden to the stars
    And his limbs are white as milk.

  But, lo, he dwindles as the light
    That lifts from a black mere,
  And, as the fair youth wanes from sight,
    The steed grows mightier.

  What wizard by yon holy tree
    Mutters unto the sky
  Where Macha's flame-tongued horses flee
    On hoofs of thunder by?

  Ah, 'tis not holy so to ban
    The youth of kingly seed:
  Ah! woe, the wasting of a man
    Who changes to a steed.

  Nightly upon the Plain of Kings,
    When Macha's day is nigh,
  He gallops; and the dark wind brings
    His lonely human cry.


THOMAS BOYD.
