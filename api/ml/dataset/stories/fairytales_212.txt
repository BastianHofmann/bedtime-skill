They went down, down, down, till at last they came to a passage with
a door at one end, which was only fastened with a latch. The eldest
Princess opened it, and they found themselves immediately in a lovely
little wood, where the leaves were spangled with drops of silver which
shone in the brilliant light of the moon.

They next crossed another wood where the leaves were sprinkled with
gold, and after that another still, where the leaves glittered with
diamonds.

At last the Star Gazer perceived a large lake, and on the shores of
the lake twelve little boats with awnings, in which were seated twelve
princes, who, grasping their oars, awaited the princesses.

Each princess entered one of the boats, and Michael slipped into that
which held the youngest. The boats glided along rapidly, but Lina's,
from being heavier, was always behind the rest. 'We never went so slowly
before,' said the Princess; 'what can be the reason?'

'I don't know,' answered the Prince. 'I assure you I am rowing as hard
as I can.'

On the other side of the lake the garden boy saw a beautiful castle
splendidly illuminated, whence came the lively music of fiddles,
kettle-drums, and trumpets.

In a moment they touched land, and the company jumped out of the boats;
and the princes, after having securely fastened their barques, gave
their arms to the princesses and conducted them to the castle.
