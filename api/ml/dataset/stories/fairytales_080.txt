   The maabah, with the picturesque Arab architecture of
  which it forms a part, is fast disappearing from Egypt. In
  Cairo and Alexandria, Moammad 'Alee ordered that the maabahs
  in the thoroughfare-streets should be removed, or reduced to
  about a foot in width; and interdicted the erection of new
  meshrebeeyehs (projecting windows of lattice-work), although he
  allowed the old ones to remain.--ED.
