_The Moral_

    _O curiosity, thou mortal bane!
    Spite of thy charms, thou causest often pain
    And sore regret, of which we daily find
    A thousand instances attend mankind:
    For thou--O may it not displease the fair--
    A fleeting pleasure art, but lasting care.
    And always proves, alas! too dear the prize,
    Which, in the moment of possession, dies._


_Another_

    _A very little share of common sense,
    And knowledge of the world, will soon evince
    That this a story is of time long pass'd;
    No husbands now such panic terrors cast;
    Nor weakly, with a vain despotic hand,
    Imperious, what's impossible, command:
    And be they discontented, or the fire
    Of wicked jealousy their hearts inspire,
    They softly sing; and of whatever hue
    Their beards may chance to be, or black, or blue,
    Grizeld, or russet, it is hard to say
    Which of the two, the man or wife, bears sway._
